Jenkins is an open source continuous integration CI and continuous delivery tool written in Java.
It's an automation server used to build and deliver SW projects.
Was forked from another a-like server Hudson, after dispute or fight with Oracle.
It's cool to pack app in docker since it is isolated environment, and you can be more sure that your app works.
Major feature in Jenkins - plugins.

Jenkins is open source and well known but there are alternatives:
  - Self-hosted: Drone CI, TeamCity (by JetBrains)
  - Hosted (SaaS): Wercker, CircleCI, CodeShip, SemaphoreCI, Amazone AWS CI/CI tools.

Continious Integration - is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several
times a day. Continious Delivery - is the approach in which teams produce SW in short cycles, ensures that.
SW can be released in any moment. In practice CI/CD says that we will verify and publish SW by triggering
automated builds and test.

All developers push their changes to VCS where code tested at least once a day.
CI/CD with SDLC (SW development life cycle)
New Feature (by dev) ->
 Push (be dev) ->
  Build (by Jenkins) ->
   Test (Unit, Integration, Regression, Acceptance, etc) (by Jenkins) ->
    Release (Package SW, to tar, zip, jar, docker) (by Jenkins) ->
     :optional Distribute(to private storage/docker registry) ->
      Deploy to production(by Jenkins).

To install Jenkins with docker:
mkdir -p /var/jenkins_home
chown -R 1000:1000 /var/jenkins_home/
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -d --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts

We can make a jenkins with docker client, so jenkins container can run docker commands.

It's easy to setup Jenkins via UI. But there are several disadvantages of this approach:
- No audit trail, you'll never know who make a change, that break something.
- No history of changes, you don't know what was changed, that break something.
- No ability to easy backup or restore Jenkins setup.
- Usually developers don't have rights to change Jenkins setup, admins have, it takes time.

Many of those troubles will be solved if we will store Jenkins setup in Jenkins DSL, in VCS.

Job DSL - Jenkins plugin that allows to define jobs in programmatic way. It use Groovy based language
 Groovy - is like scripting language for Java platform.
