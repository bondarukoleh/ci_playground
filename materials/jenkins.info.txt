Jenkins is an open source continuous integration CI and continuous delivery tool written in Java.
It's an automation server used to build and deliver SW projects.
Was forked from another a-like server Hudson, after dispute or fight with Oracle.
Major feature in Jenkins - plugins.
Jenkins is open source and well known but there are alternatives: , , but
  - Self-hosted: Drone CI, TeamCity (by JetBrains)
  - Hosted (SaaS): Wercker, CircleCI, CodeShip, SemaphoreCI, Amazone AWS CI/CI tools.

All developers push their changes to VCS where code tested at least once a day.

CI/CD with SDLC (SW development life cycle)
New Feature (by dev) ->
 Push (be dev) ->
  Build (by Jenkins) ->
   Test (Unit, Integration, Regression, Acceptance, etc) (by Jenkins) ->
    Release (Package SW, to tar, zip, jar, docker) (by Jenkins) ->
     :optional Distribute(to private storage/docker registry) ->
      Deploy to production(by Jenkins).

To install Jenkins with docker:
mkdir -p /var/jenkins_home
chown -R 1000:1000 /var/jenkins_home/
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -d --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts

It's cool to pack app in docker since it is isolated environment, and you can be more sure that your app works.
